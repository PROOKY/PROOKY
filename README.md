## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal GitHub account. I'm a first year cs student in Bilkent. Over the next few years, I aspire to develop my skills in programming, problem-solving, and software development to pursue my ultimate goal of becoming a computer engineer. Besides my studies, some of my hobbies include sports, reading and gaming.
